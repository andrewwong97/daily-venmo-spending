# daily-venmo-spending

I am interested in seeing my daily venmo spending habits in an easy-to-use app

## Edit: don't waste your time trying to decipher the code because I realized Venmo OAuth doesn't work very well with just a client side application. Although possible to do with create-react-app and github pages, you kinda need a server to implement this well.
